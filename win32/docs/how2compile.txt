Various software and tools are required to compile Snes9x on Windows:

- Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1 or Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 SP5 with the
  latest Platform SDK, to compile all the C++ source code.
  The current official binary is compiled with Visual Studio 2008

- A recent DirectX SDK. The official binary is compiled against the June 2008 SDK.

- nasm(optional). I use version 0.97. Used to assemble the optional ZSNES FX and C4 core
  included in Snes9x. Download from www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm
  Note: the official binary does not use the asm files.

- zlib(optional) - The release binaries are built against a static zlib compiled
  against VC's multi-threaded C runtime and renamed to zlibmt.lib, to avoid linker conflicts.
  removing ZLIB from the preprocessor definitions and zlibmt.lib from the library
  listing will disable zip support.
  (the zlib directory should reside at win32/../../zlib, i.e. 2 directories up, the
  lib file is expected in win32/../../zlib/lib)

- libpng(optional) - Like zlib, this is a renamed libpng.lib, built against the same
  C runtime for the same reasons. Building your own is as simple as changing the runtime
  used by libpng's own project files, compiling, renaming the result to libpngmt.lib
  HAVE_LIBPNG is the define used to include this code, used for screenshots.
  (the libpng directory should reside at win32/../../libpng, i.e. 2 directories up)

- fmod(optional) - Versions 3.20 and above. Used to provide extra sound output
  options that increases hardware compatibility with some PC hardware.
  Version 3.33 broke A3D support on some hardware so I reverted back to
  version 3.20. However, I'm told 3.40, just released at time of writing,  fixes the problem.
  Download from www.fmod.org Unpack into a temp folder and copy the API
  sub-folder contents into win32/../../fmod. Disable fmod support by removing the
  FMOD_SUPPORT from the Preprocessor Definitions text box.

- fmod ex(optional) - Used to provide extra sound output. Cannot be used at the same time as
  normal FMOD support. Disable fmod support by removing the FMODEX_SUPPORT from the Preprocessor
  Definitions text box.

- To compile Snes9x:
    Run the MAKEASM.BAT script. nasmw will need to be on your path
      for the script to work. Only necessary if you want to compile with ZSNES_C4 or ZSNES_FX
    Start up Visual C++.
    Load the Snes9x project file.
    Select the desired configuration and build.
    The Release configuration may build significantly slower than Debug.
    Then you can run it.
